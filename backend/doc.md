# **Digital Asset Management (DAM) Platform**

Companies today generate and manage a large volume of digital assets — including images, videos, and documents — across multiple teams, projects, and marketing channels. However, most businesses lack a centralized and scalable solution to:

- Upload multiple large files efficiently
- Process assets in the background (e.g., generate thumbnails, compress videos, extract metadata)
- Tag, categorize, and search assets based on content
- Allow teams to preview, download, and share assets securely
- Scale processing and storage as the volume grows

## Scope of work

### **1. User Flow**

- Upload multiple files (images/videos) via frontend (drag-and-drop or API)
- View uploaded files in a gallery with search and filters
- Download or preview files in browser
- Auto-tag assets using filename, MIME, and basic metadata

### **2. Background Processing (BullMQ workers)**

- Generate thumbnails for images
- Transcode videos to multiple resolutions (1080p, 720p)
- Extract metadata (file type, size, dimensions)
- Store all assets in object storage (MinIO or S3)

### **3. Dashboard (Admin View)**

- Asset browser with filters: type, date, tags
- Download counts, upload counts, latest assets
- Asset usage analytics (dummy or from Redis stats)

### **4. Architecture/DevOps**

- Use Docker + Docker Swarm to orchestrate:
    - API service
    - Worker service (asset processor)
    - Redis + BullMQ dashboard
    - Object storage (MinIO)
- Scale workers based on queue size

### **Tech Stack**

- Frontend: React + Tailwind
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Queue: BullMQ + Redis
- Object Storage: MinIO
- Video/Image tools: FFmpeg, Sharp
- Deployment: Docker Swarm (with scale configs)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. High-level overview

This DAM platform separates concerns cleanly:

Frontend (React + Tailwind): upload UI (drag & drop), gallery, admin dashboard.

API Service (Node.js + Express): accepts uploads, stores metadata, enqueues processing jobs, serves search, preview, and downloads.

Workers (BullMQ + Node): background processors that generate thumbnails, transcode video (FFmpeg), extract metadata, and push final assets to object storage.

Queue & Broker (Redis + BullMQ): reliable job queue with visibility into queue length and job states.

Object Storage (MinIO / S3): durable storage for originals and derived artifacts (thumbnails, transcodes).

Database (Postgres): asset metadata, tags, user permissions, download counts, analytics pointers.

Monitoring & Dashboard: BullMQ dashboard, Prometheus/Grafana (metrics), ELK/Opensearch (logs).

Orchestration (Docker Swarm): run API, worker pools, Redis, MinIO, and dashboards with scale policies.

2. Component responsibilities
Frontend

Chunked / resumable uploads for large files (e.g. tus or multipart chunking) to the API.

Gallery UI: filters, search, preview, download.

Admin dashboard for analytics and queue/worker status.

API Service

Auth (JWT / OAuth) and upload endpoints.

Validate file types (MIME checks) and compute initial metadata.

Persist asset metadata in Postgres and create Job entries in BullMQ.

Provide signed URLs for direct object-store upload/download when appropriate.

Worker Service

Consume jobs from BullMQ.

Image jobs: run sharp to create thumbnails, different sizes, and optimize images.

Video jobs: run ffmpeg to transcode (1080p, 720p), create poster frames.

Metadata extraction: compute dimensions, duration, codec info, checksums.

On success: upload derived artifacts to MinIO and update DB records.

On failure: retry/backoff policies and Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) handling.

Storage & Database

MinIO (S3-compatible): store originals/, thumbnails/, transcodes/ with lifecycle rules.

Postgres: assets, asset_versions, tags, users, usage_stats tables.

Queueing and Scaling

BullMQ (Redis): use job priorities, rate-limiting, delayed jobs, and separate queues (image-queue, video-queue).

Scale workers horizontally by increasing worker containers in Docker Swarm depending on queue length and job types.

3. Data flow (step-by-step)

User uploads file via frontend (multipart or direct put to MinIO with signed URL).

API accepts upload or confirms direct upload and creates asset DB record in assets with status: uploaded.

API enqueues a job on appropriate queue (image/video) with metadata and S3 path.

Worker picks up job, downloads the object from MinIO, processes (sharp/ffmpeg), uploads derived files back to MinIO.

Worker updates the assets record with derived object paths, metadata, and status: processed.

Frontend polls or receives websocket/notifications for job completion and shows derived images, preview links, etc.

4. Reliability, scaling & operational notes

Use chunked uploads or direct browser->S3 uploads to reduce API bandwidth.

Use separate queues: lightweight image tasks vs heavy video transcodes.

Use autoscaling rules in Swarm (or external orchestrator) to scale workers when queue length > threshold.

Use lifecycle policies on MinIO (e.g., keep originals for X days or tier to cheaper storage).

Use content-addressable storage or checksums to avoid duplicate processing.

5. Security

Signed URLs (time-limited) for direct MinIO access.

Role-based access control for admin vs viewers.

Scan uploads for malware (optional third-party service).

Enforce rate limits on API endpoints.

6. Monitoring & Observability

Metrics: queue lengths, job durations, worker CPU/RAM, request latencies. (Prometheus)

Logs: structured logs from API & workers shipped to ELK / Opensearch or Loki.

Alerts: job failure rate spike, queue depth high, MinIO storage usage.

Dashboard: BullMQ dashboard for job-level view + Grafana for system metrics.

7. Deployment (Docker Swarm example)

Services to deploy:

api (replicas: 2, behind load balancer)

worker-image (replicas variable)

worker-video (replicas variable, CPU/GPU tuned)

redis (stateful)

minio (stateful)

postgres (stateful)

bullmq-dashboard (single)

prometheus, grafana, logging

Use volumes for MinIO and Postgres; ensure backups for DB and MinIO.



Asset:
    assets (id, original_path, status, mime, size, uploaded_by, created_at, updated_at)
    asset_versions (asset_id, path, type [thumbnail, transcode], resolution, metadata JSON)
    tags (id, name)
    asset_tags (asset_id, tag_id)
    usage_stats (asset_id, downloads, views, last_accessed)
